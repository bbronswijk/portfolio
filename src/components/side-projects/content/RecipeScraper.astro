        Are all your favorite recipes scattered around the web? And would you like to have them all in one
        place?
        I used Playwright and the Bing Chat bot to create a bot that scrapes recipes from the web and adds them
        to my recipe app.
    </p>
    <p class="flex-1">
        By now I've built a few recipe apps to experiment with frameworks like Ionic, Angular and Next.js. The bot
        makes sure there is enough content to play around with.
